# Bottomnav bar

This component implements an elegant curved bottom navigation bar that serves as the primary navigation interface for ChemGeek Pro. Built using Flutter's curved_navigation_bar package, it provides users with quick access to four essential sections of the application: the Home page for quick access to features and recent activities, the Molecular Visualizer for interactive 3D molecule rendering and structure analysis, the Calculator Hub containing various chemistry calculators for equations, molar mass, concentration conversions and more, and the User Profile for personalized settings and account management. The navigation bar features a distinctive indigo color scheme that reflects the app's scientific identity, coupled with smooth 500-millisecond animations that create a fluid user experience. Its curved design not only adds visual appeal but also provides clear feedback for the currently selected tab, making navigation intuitive and enjoyable throughout the application.RetryClaude can make mistakes.
