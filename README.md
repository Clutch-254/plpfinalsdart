# Calculator Hub

The Calculator Hub is a comprehensive computational toolkit within ChemGeek Pro that provides six specialized chemistry calculators in an intuitive sidebar interface. This feature-rich module enables users to perform essential chemistry calculations including molecular weight determination, stoichiometry analysis for reaction yields and limiting reagents, solution preparation with precise concentration and volume specifications, automatic chemical equation balancing with step-by-step explanations, pH calculations for acids, bases, and buffer solutions with visual pH scale representation, and gas law computations covering ideal gas law, Boyle's Law, Charles's Law, and other fundamental gas relationships. Each calculator is color-coded for easy identification and features dedicated input fields, real-time validation, and detailed result displays with relevant chemical constants and reference information. The hub's split-screen design with a persistent sidebar allows seamless navigation between different calculators while maintaining user inputs, making it an indispensable tool for students conducting homework problems, researchers planning experiments, and chemistry professionals requiring quick, accurate calculations. The interface includes helpful reference materials such as common compounds with their molecular weights, reaction type classifications, acid-base pKa values, and gas law constants, ensuring users have all necessary information at their fingertips for efficient chemical computations.

# Homepage
The Homepage User component serves as the central dashboard and primary landing page for ChemGeek Pro users, providing a personalized and intuitive gateway to all the app's features and resources. Upon login, users are greeted with a welcoming card displaying their profile information and last login timestamp, creating a personalized experience that enhances user engagement. The page features a Quick Access Tools grid with six beautifully designed cards offering instant navigation to the most frequently used features including the Periodic Table, Molecular Weight Calculator, Equation Balancer, pH Calculator, Molecular Visualizer, and a portal to additional tools. Each tool card is color-coded with distinctive icons for easy identification and quick access. Below the tools section, the homepage displays a Recent Calculations list that tracks the user's calculation history with detailed information about each computation including the calculation type, formula or equation used, and the date performed, allowing users to quickly revisit previous work. The interface also includes a horizontally scrollable Chemistry News section featuring the latest developments and breakthroughs in chemistry from reputable sources like Chemistry World, Science Daily, and Chemical & Engineering News, keeping users informed about current trends and discoveries in the field. The clean, card-based design with indigo accents throughout maintains visual consistency with the app's branding while ensuring all information is organized and easily accessible. The top app bar includes a prominent ChemGeek logo, search functionality, notification center, and quick profile access, making this homepage a comprehensive hub that combines functionality, information, and personalization to deliver an exceptional user experience for chemistry enthusiasts and professionals alike.RetryClaude can make mistakes. 


# Molecular visualiser


The Molecular Visualizer is an advanced, dual-mode molecular structure tool that combines interactive 3D visualization capabilities with a comprehensive 2D structure editor, making it an essential feature for understanding and creating chemical structures within ChemGeek Pro. The module offers two distinct operating modes: a sophisticated 3D View that allows users to explore molecular geometry through interactive rotation controls (drag to rotate, auto-rotation toggle, and zoom functionality), providing real-time visualization of molecular structures with proper atom coloring and bond representations; and a powerful 2D Editor that enables users to build custom molecular structures from scratch using an intuitive drawing interface with tools for adding atoms (C, H, O, N, S, P, F, Cl, Br), creating various bond types (single, double, triple, wedge, and dashed bonds), and manipulating structures with select and erase modes. The visualizer includes a Quick Access Molecules library featuring commonly studied compounds like Water, Methane, Benzene, Ethanol, and Glucose for instant loading and exploration. A detailed structural properties panel displays critical molecular information including molecular formula, molecular weight, bond angles, bond lengths, hybridization state, polarity, and molecular geometry, providing comprehensive analytical data for each structure. The interface supports professional workflows with import/export functionality for multiple file formats including MDL MOL files, Protein Data Bank (PDB) files, XYZ coordinates, Chemical Markup Language (CML), and SMILES strings, as well as export options for PNG and SVG images. Built with Flutter's CustomPainter for smooth rendering performance, the visualizer employs animation controllers for fluid 3D rotations and gesture detection for interactive manipulation. The dark-themed 3D view provides excellent contrast for viewing molecular structures, while the grid-based 2D editor offers precision placement and alignment of atoms and bonds. This dual-mode approach makes the Molecular Visualizer suitable for both educational purposes (studying molecular geometry and bonding) and practical applications (designing new compounds or analyzing existing structures), serving as a complete molecular modeling solution within the ChemGeek Pro ecosystem.
