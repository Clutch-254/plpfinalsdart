# Bottomnav bar

This component implements an elegant curved bottom navigation bar that serves as the primary navigation interface for ChemGeek Pro. Built using Flutter's curved_navigation_bar package, it provides users with quick access to four essential sections of the application: the Home page for quick access to features and recent activities, the Molecular Visualizer for interactive 3D molecule rendering and structure analysis, the Calculator Hub containing various chemistry calculators for equations, molar mass, concentration conversions and more, and the User Profile for personalized settings and account management. The navigation bar features a distinctive indigo color scheme that reflects the app's scientific identity, coupled with smooth 500-millisecond animations that create a fluid user experience. Its curved design not only adds visual appeal but also provides clear feedback for the currently selected tab, making navigation intuitive and enjoyable throughout the application.RetryClaude can make mistakes.

# Calculator Hub

The Calculator Hub is a comprehensive computational toolkit within ChemGeek Pro that provides six specialized chemistry calculators in an intuitive sidebar interface. This feature-rich module enables users to perform essential chemistry calculations including molecular weight determination, stoichiometry analysis for reaction yields and limiting reagents, solution preparation with precise concentration and volume specifications, automatic chemical equation balancing with step-by-step explanations, pH calculations for acids, bases, and buffer solutions with visual pH scale representation, and gas law computations covering ideal gas law, Boyle's Law, Charles's Law, and other fundamental gas relationships. Each calculator is color-coded for easy identification and features dedicated input fields, real-time validation, and detailed result displays with relevant chemical constants and reference information. The hub's split-screen design with a persistent sidebar allows seamless navigation between different calculators while maintaining user inputs, making it an indispensable tool for students conducting homework problems, researchers planning experiments, and chemistry professionals requiring quick, accurate calculations. The interface includes helpful reference materials such as common compounds with their molecular weights, reaction type classifications, acid-base pKa values, and gas law constants, ensuring users have all necessary information at their fingertips for efficient chemical computations.
